  <b>Introduction</b>
  <p>
    Imagine a place where software engineers can come together and create opportunities for people to ask, answer, and learn from each other</a>, sharing knowledge. This exciting idea we can call effective communication fuels success and its found within Stack Overflow. For software engineers, asking questions becomes common, helping and working as a team to be better for each other. We'll draw inspiration from Eric Raymond's timeless wisdom in his essay, "<b>How to Ask Questions the Smart Way</b>," to explore the importance of effective communication.

  <b>Smart Question Summary</b>
  <p>
    Before examining "smart" questions on StackOverflow, let's set some guidelines when talking about "smart" questions by adhering to the principles outlined by Eric Raymond. It implies the question was clear, specific, and well-researched, providing details of their prior attempts and the problem's context. This intelligent approach prompts the community to respond with efficient and practical help, demonstrating the benefits of respectful and well-prepared inquiries within the software engineering community.

  <b>Not Smart Question Summary</b>
  <p>
    Contrastingly, before discussing "not smart" questions seeking assistance. A question could need more specificity, context, and prior research effort, disregarding the guidelines set by Raymond. Consequently, the responses from the community could be more on the unhelpful and occasionally critical side, where you are underscoring the importance of crafting thoughtful and well-structured questions to foster productive interactions and receive valuable assistance within the software development community.

  <b>Smart Question and Not-so-smart Question:</b>
  <p>
    An example of a not-so-smart <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77057180/my-navbar-wont-show-at-the-top-of-the-screen">question</a> would be this: 
    In this question, he asks why his desired nav bar appearance won't appear correctly. A simple line in the html code closes </nav> too early. This question only required a little attention or effort to answer after looking over it quickly and noticing that they closed the nav in two instances.
  </p>
  <p>
    An example of a smart question would be this:
    In the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77057313/unable-to-obtain-the-locales-file-content-when-using-multiple-files-for-same-lan">question</a>, they ask clearly and concisely about their issue. They provide relevant content by mentioning the tools and technologies they are utilizing. This does help anyone who can answer to understand the scope of the subject better. They provided snippets of their code on the question showing the work they have done so far and have provided a particular question requiring a lot of effort and thought to figure it out. 
  </p>

  <b>Conclusion</b>
  <p>
    From this, we can take away that asking the right questions is essential when taking someone's time. Someone trying to give you feedback should be faced with an intelligent question. So you can walk away learning and understanding what work you have done better and how to help someone with a challenging issue in the future.
