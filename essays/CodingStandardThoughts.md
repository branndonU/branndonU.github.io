    At first glimpse, coding standards seem like the little details that don't matter in programming. However, as I've gained more experience, I've realized how essential they are. They furnish structure, promote cooperation among developers, and help us develop good coding habits. Beyond these surface benefits, coding standards are valuable tools for learning programming languages and recognizing coding patterns.

    My journey with ESLint and IntelliJ has been a mix of challenges and rewards. When I first encountered ESLint's complexity, it felt overwhelming. But, it was beneficial, forcing me to address my coding inconsistencies. Over time, I've come to appreciate the green checkmark it provides as a reliable indicator of code quality and my progress as a coder.

    In summary, despite their seemingly small consequence, coding standards are the basis of disciplined coding and mastering programming languages. While tools like ESLint may seem stern initially, they eventually help us become better coders. Adopting coding standards is the key to building well-structured, coherent, and maintainable code, particularly for those still learning the ropes in programming.
