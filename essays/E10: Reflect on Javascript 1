E10: Reflect on Javascript 1

So far, Javascript is interesting. When comparing these other languages, Javascript looks familiar compared to what I'm used to seeing in Java. I did relearn things because, in the past, I forgot about things from the start. Starting from the ground up, we are bringing information that I have yet to look back on, which is helping me to become familiarized again. Javascript has to be a good language from a software engineering perspective, mainly because it is a good starting point in most people's journeys if they decide to learn code. It definitely will offer a challenge and has done that so far, showing completely new people a sense of what things could be like more down the road of them learning code. In short, it's an excellent middle ground due to its difficulty level and syntax involved in it. Now, talking about WODs from this class, they are a new idea and something I have never done, and they are helpful because, especially in a group, you can learn and better yourself from others. WODs will offer nervousness and get your brain to work to its best ability, recalling all you can think of that you know. It is stressful and enjoyable as long as you progress well, which we all can hopefully do. It will work great. I enjoy getting hit with challenges because it will tell me what I need to know, and hopefully, after that WOD, I can get some closure on myself and feel confident to move forward.
