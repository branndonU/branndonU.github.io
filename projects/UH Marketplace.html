 <p><b>Introduction to UH Marketplace</b></p>
<p>The UH Marketplace is an innovative online platform designed and developed through the collaborative efforts of our team, leveraging the skills honed in our ICS 314 class and the principles of agile project management. The core aim of UH Marketplace is to provide a virtual space where students can conveniently buy and sell items within the University of Hawaii community. This project is a practical application of our coursework, embodying the spirit of entrepreneurship among students.</p>
