summary: I built my own PC
---
At the end of my high school senior year, I put together a Personal Computer. To this day, I have worked on 6 computers for my family and 2 friends. I had used a prebuilt previously that I wasn't too happy with and wanted to change that. Two of my friends had already done this, and I was inspired. I taught myself online from mostly LinusTT and dove into picking and choosing. The computer I made was overkill, and that's how I wanted it to be. I used a very unheard-of case from Lian Li. Doing this taught me how a computer is connected behind the scenes, and it does help to know this when it comes to problems using said hardware. I can deduce what may be lacking and or needs to be better for some desired outcomes for my friends/family. I now understand how hardware comes together and what it can do for a computer.
