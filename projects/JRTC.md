summary: A look into an experience I had over the Summer of 2023
---
Recently, I went to Louisiana in July 2023 as an E-4 SPC. In JRTC, my Hawaii Army National Guard unit was sent to FT. Polk. We all are expected to work on our MOS and other tasks that are assigned to us. My MOS being in the S-2 section of Intelligence required me to work closely with my OIC and prepare products to show to our BN Commander daily. We moved into the Box about two weeks into our time there. The Box is the simulated area in FT. Polk, which we slept out in for two weeks. If I had to describe JRTC in more detail, I would say... 

The Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) is a high-tech practice ground for the US military at Fort Polk, Louisiana. It's all about helping different parts of the military, even international teams, learn to work together better by simulating real battles and emergencies. JRTC sets up situations that feel like the real deal, using excellent technology and tactics that soldiers might use in modern warfare.

JRTC's primary goals are to ensure military units are ready for challenging situations and can cooperate smoothly. They create scenarios challenging soldiers' decision-making and leadership skills, like dealing with complex urban warfare or unexpected dangers. At the center, soldiers from different military branches learn to team up effectively, ensuring everyone is prepared and can work together when actual missions come around.
